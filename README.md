This explores different traditional ML and Deep Learning Algorithms on IMDB sentiment analysis data set. 
This can be seen as a tutorial on how to solve NLP problems using Random Forest and Word2Vec and comparision in performance.

The Dataset and the Word Vector algorithm has been taken from the following publication.

Andrew L. Maas, Raymond E. Daly, Peter T. Pham, Dan Huang, Andrew Y. Ng, and Christopher Potts. (2011).
"Learning Word Vectors for Sentiment Analysis."
